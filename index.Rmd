Welcome to The Q! 
I am a third-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics & Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University. 
Previously, I completed my MS in Applied Statistics at Loyola University Chicago and BS in Mathematics and Data Science at Wittenberg University.

I am broadly interested in statistical modeling in complex and high-dimensional settings.
During my PhD, I have worked on problems in areas such as tracking data in sports and social networks.

I am a member of the [Carnegie Mellon Sports Analytics Center](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/cmsac) and an organizer of the [CMSAC Research Lab](https://cmsac-research-lab.github.io).
