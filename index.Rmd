Welcome to my personal website! I recently finished my MS in Applied Statistics at Loyola University Chicago. For the Spring 2022 semester, I am staying at Loyola as an instructor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics. My interests include statistics in sports, supervised learning, data visualization, and using R and RStudio for data science.
