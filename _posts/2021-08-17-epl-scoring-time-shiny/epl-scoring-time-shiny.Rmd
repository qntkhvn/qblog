One of the items on my to-do list for this summer is to learn and make a Shiny app. I finally did it! Check out the app here: https://qntkhvn.shinyapps.io/epl_goal_time

## Description

This is a very simple Shiny app which provides data on all goal scoring events in the English Premier League, from its first season, 1992-93, to the last completed season, 2020-21. 

Some flaws:

Goals weren't classified as own goals

Future work:



## EDA

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
theme_set(theme_bw())
```

```{r}
goals <- read_csv("goals.csv")
```

**Who were the Top 5 All-Time EPL Goal Scorers?**

```{r}
goals %>% 
  count(goal_scorer, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  slice_head(n = 5)
```

**Which players have scored more than 30 goals in a season?**

```{r}
goals %>% 
  count(goal_scorer, season, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  filter(n >= 30)
```

(Note: There were 22 clubs and 42 matchweeks in the first 3 EPL seasons (92-93, 93-94, 94-95))

**What are the highest-scoring teams in the EPL history?**

```{r}
goals %>% 
  count(goal_club, season, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  filter(n >= 90)
```

**What is the goal scoring trend since 2010?**

```{r, fig.height = 6}
goals %>% 
  filter(as.numeric(str_sub(season, end = -6)) > 2009) %>% 
  mutate(season = str_replace(season, "-", "-\n")) %>% 
  count(season) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = season, y = n, group = 1)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = n), show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(subtitle = "2014-2015 seems to be an outlier")
```
