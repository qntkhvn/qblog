Welcome to my new blog, The Q! This post is nothing more than a "Hello, World" post.

#### RULES

</center>

-   Football means the real football here, not the American one.

    -   Match, not game.

    -   Draw, not tie.

    -   Pitch, not field.

    -   Table, not standings.

    -   Nil, not zero/zip/nothing/whatever.

    -   Boots, not cleats.

    -   Kit, not uniform.
    
    -   What else?

-   Cereals, pancakes, and waffles are desserts.
