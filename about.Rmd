## Biography

<!-- <center> -->

<!-- ![](qpic2.png){width=45%} -->

<!-- </center> -->

I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in the Department of Statistics & Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University.
I completed my Master of Science degree in Applied Statistics at Loyola University Chicago in December 2021. More previously, I graduated from Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio with a BS in Mathematics and Data Science in May 2020. I am originally from Nha Trang, Khanh Hoa, which is located in the South Central Coast of Vietnam (hence this is what `qntkhvn` represents). In my free time, you may find me watching sports, listening to podcasts, and cooking. I am a huge supporter of Manchester United F.C. of the English Premier League.

My full name in Vietnamese: Nguyễn Ngọc Minh Quang
