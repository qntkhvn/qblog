My name is Quang Nguyen, and I am currently a graduate student at Loyola University Chicago, pursuing a Master of Science degree in Applied Statistics. I previously completed my undergraduate study at Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio, graduating in May 2020 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics and Data Science. I am originally from Nha Trang, Khanh Hoa, which is located in the South Central Coast of Vietnam (hence this is what the username `qntkhvn` represents). In my free time, you may find me watching sports, listening to podcasts, and cooking. I am a huge supporter of Manchester United F.C. of the English Premier League as well as NBA's LA Clippers.
