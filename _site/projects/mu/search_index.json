[["index.html", "Footy Fan 1 Me, Myself &amp; Soccer", " Footy Fan Quang Nguyen 1 Me, Myself &amp; Soccer Soccer, more commonly known as football or association football, is probably the sport that I love the most. I have been following “The King of Sports” for more than 15 years. During this period of time, I have witnessed some of the best matches in the history of the game and also have experienced plenty of emotions, from happiness and cheerfulness to anxiety, frustration and despondency. Soccer is the one sport that I enjoy watching more than playing (I’m not that athletic), so this “book” will primarily focus on my experience watching footy. I will talk about how I became fond of international soccer alongside with my favorite club and match. "],["the-good-ol-days.html", "2 The Good Ol’ Days", " 2 The Good Ol’ Days When I was a kid, soccer was televised on Vietnamese national television. There were English Premier League and Spanish La Liga matches on every weekend and UEFA Champions League games on during the middle of the week. In the summer, they televised the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA Euro. I remember that after I started watching footy, I quickly learned all of the team’s names, the players and who did each of them play played for at that time. I also loved to read sports newspapers in the morning to see the scores of the night before’s matches (The Internet was not popular in Vietnam when I was a kid, of course). We moved to our current house in 2003. Back then, our house did not have cable, so my dad often took me to my uncle’s house to watch the Saturday/Sunday earliest Premier League match. Our house finally have cable TV in 2006, and this has allowed me to watch games at home since then. During this early time, I also fell in love with Manchester United - an English football club. "],["true-manucian.html", "3 True Manucian 3.1 Then 3.2 Now", " 3 True Manucian Manchester United Being a sports fan is fun. But is is even more interesting to watch sports when you have some specific teams to root for. In my case, there’s one team that I have been supporting and will always support, and they are, the Manchester United “Red Devils”. MU is the most decorated English club of all time, with a record of 20 leagues titles. The club is also the most popular football club on this planet. 3.1 Then I began to cheer for MU since I was 3 or 4 years old (I couldn’t remember correctly). At that time, they were a team managed by Sir Alex Ferguson and consisted of veterans like Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Gary Neville,… alongside with 2 “superstars” in the making in Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney. My first few seasons following MU were when Chelsea dominated the league, and my club did not win any trophies in several years. But the team quickly developed and played better together, and their peak season was 2007-08, where they won the Premier League and their first Champions League title since 1999. United then went on to win a few more domestic league titles, but they also broke my heart twice in 2009 and 2011 by losing to the same opponent in those years’ UEFA Champions League Final - FC Barcelona. In the summer of 2009, Cristiano Ronaldo - who was my favorite footballer back then - left Manchester for Real Madrid. And in 2013, the club received one shocking announcement that Sir Alex Fergurson has decided to retire after more than 26 years of coaching MU. I was shocked when I heard the news. 3.2 Now After the Sir Alex Era, MU has had 3 different coaches, but they still have not won another Premier League or Champions League title. Right now, the club still doesn’t look like who they were in the past, but I believe that they are moving in the right direction. The road to victory is still under construction, but MU will soon complete the process and regain the status of the best club in England and Europe. "],["the-match.html", "4 The Match", " 4 The Match Over the course of my 15+ years following football, I have seen so many great games. Some of them include Liverpool vs AC Milan (2005 Champions League Final), Italy vs England (UEFA Euro 2012), Borussia Dortmund vs Real Madrid (2012-13 Champions League Semifinal - First Leg),… But the most memorable match I have witnessed was the 2008 UEFA Champions League Final between my favorite club, Manchester United, and their domestic rivals Chelsea. May 22, 2008…I woke up and turned on the TV at about 2 hours past midnight (an alarm was set the night before)… The usual Champions League theme song has sounded (which is arguably the best sport theme song of all time - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQK0wgi678U)… Game on! United had control in the early stages of the match, and as a result, Ronaldo scored a header and put us in front. After that, we missed a few opportunities to extend the lead. And then, Chelsea started to take control, and they had an equalizer just before the first half ended. I was really nervous after Chelsea scored. Chelsea then continued to attack and their players almost put the ball in the back of the net twice - those 2 times the ball hit the woodwork. I was so relieved after those moments… End of regulation… The match is tied at one goal apiece… You know what that means - It means BONUS FOOTBALL! I quickly told my mom (who was still sleeping): “Mom! The match is going to extra time! Wake up!”. Normally, my mom doesn’t care much about watching sports, but on this particular night, she decided to wake up and watch the game with me. During 30 minutes of extra time, nobody scored. The umpire then blew the whistle to mark the end of the extra time period. We’re having a penalty shoot-out! Prior to this game, I’ve never seen a live penalty shoot-out, so I was a little nervous. I could feel the pressure on both teams as my heart started to beat fast. Both teams made their first shots… Then, our best player, Cristiano Ronaldo, missed his attempt. I was telling myself: “Oh no! Please don’t!”. After this miss, both teams continued to do well, and Chelsea had a chance to ice the game with their fifth kick. At that moment, I could not control my emotions anymore, so I started crying. I was holding my mom’s hand as Chelsea’s captain John Terry stepped up to take his kick. And the miracle happened… He missed it! He lost his footing and slipped! The ball hit the right post! It went wide! Unbelievable! I cried harder, but this time not because of nervousness, it’s because I was too happy and relieved. And then… here comes the moment that I’ve been waiting for. The shoot-out right now is “sudden death”. We made our first 2, Chelsea made their first, and about to take their second… He shoots… A SAVE!!!… Our goalkeeper, Edwin Van der Sar, has pulled of the save of his career! The Red Devils are on top of Europe once again! The Old Continent is RED! Manchester United players with their UEFA Champions League trophy Wow! What an astonishing match! The best match of my life! Here’s a link to the match recap, for you viewing pleasure: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIMDplQiZgk "],["bucket-list.html", "5 Bucket List", " 5 Bucket List I have never been to a real soccer game in my life. I believe there is a huge difference between watching football on TV and seeing it at the stadium. It’s all about the atmosphere. You’ll also get to cheer for your team, shout and sing with other supporters. So my dream is to do the following things: First, I want to attend a Manchester United match. This dream almost came true. United will play against Liverpool on July 28, 2018 at the Big House in Ann Arbor, Michigan. I’d love to go to that game, but unfortunately, I will be in Vietnam by that time. So I hope they’ll have games in America in the future or they’ll choose Vietnam to be one of their summer tour destinations and play a friendly match with our team. Next, I’d love to visit Old Trafford and watch a MU home game. It would be amazing to see my favorite team playing at their home arena. I’m also interested in going to a stadium in Europe and watch a Champions League match. It would be awesome to sit in the arena and enjoy one of the best soccer competitions in the world. Finally, I hope I’ll have a chance to see a live FIFA World Cup match. The atmosphere at the best sporting event on this planet is definitely the most special. That’s my bucket list! I look forward to putting a check mark next to each of those items soon! "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
