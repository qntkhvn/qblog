More previously, I graduated from Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio with a BS in Mathematics and Data Science in May 2020. I am originally from Nha Trang, Khanh Hoa, which is located in the South Central Coast of Vietnam (hence this is what qntkhvn represents). In my free time, you may find me watching sports, listening to podcasts, and cooking. I am a huge supporter of Manchester United F.C. of the English Premier League.\nMy full name in Vietnamese: Nguyễn Ngọc Minh Quang\nEducation\n  \nPhD in Statistics and Data Science, in progress\n        Carnegie Mellon University\n  \nMS in Applied Statistics, December 2021\n        Loyola University Chicago\n  \nBS in Mathematics and Data Science, May 2020\n        Wittenberg University\nContact\n   quang@stat.cmu.edu\n\nMy old website: qntkhvn.github.io/quang\n\n\n\n",
