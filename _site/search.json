I previously graduated from\nWittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio with a BS in Mathematics and\nData Science in May 2020. I am originally from Nha Trang, Khanh Hoa,\nwhich is located in the South Central Coast of Vietnam (hence this is\nwhat the username qntkhvn represents). In my free time, you\nmay find me watching sports, listening to podcasts, and cooking. I am a\nhuge supporter of Manchester United F.C. of the English Premier League\nas well as NBA’s LA Clippers.\nEducation\n   MS in Applied Statistics,\nDecember 2021\n        Loyola University Chicago\n   BS in Mathematics and Data\nScience, May 2020\n        Wittenberg University\nInterests\nStatistics in sports\nData science\nComputing\nContact\n   nminhquang.99@gmail.com\n   @qntkhvn\nMy old website: qntkhvn.github.io/quang\n\n\n\n",
