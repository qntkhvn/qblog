I previously completed my undergraduate study at Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio, graduating in May 2020 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics and Data Science. I am originally from Nha Trang, Khanh Hoa, which is located in the South Central Coast of Vietnam (hence this is what the username qntkhvn represents). In my free time, you may find me watching sports, listening to podcasts, and cooking. I am a huge supporter of Manchester United F.C. of the English Premier League as well as NBA’s LA Clippers.\nEducation\n   MS in Applied Statistics, 2021 (Expected)\n        Loyola University Chicago\n   BS in Mathematics and Data Science, 2020\n        Wittenberg University\nInterests\nStatistics in sports\nData visualization\nUsing R and RStudio for data science\nContact\n   nminhquang.99@gmail.com\n   @qntkhvn\nMy old website: qntkhvn.github.io/quang\n\n\n\n",

Our team finished 2/50 in the First Round Leaderboard, where the goal was to build a model for predicting vaccine hesitancy.\n09/2021: I participated in a live coding session where I tried to predict the 2021 Brownlow Medal Winner for the Australian Football League (AFL). This was Rob Nguyen’s idea, where he wanted to pair up a stats person with no knowledge of Aussie rules with a journalist with domain expertise to see how well they can do at making predictions. Here are links to a video recording and an article on ABC News (Australia).\n07/2021: I ranked first in the Kaggle leaderboard of SLICED (a data science show) as an audience partipicant. The competition topic was predicting baseball home runs.\n\n\n\n",
