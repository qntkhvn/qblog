I previously graduated from Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio with a BS in Mathematics and Data Science in May 2020. I am originally from Nha Trang, Khanh Hoa, which is located in the South Central Coast of Vietnam (hence this is what the username qntkhvn represents). In my free time, you may find me watching sports, listening to podcasts, and cooking. I am a huge supporter of Manchester United F.C. of the English Premier League as well as NBA’s LA Clippers.\nEducation\n   MS in Applied Statistics, December 2021\n        Loyola University Chicago\n   BS in Mathematics and Data Science, May 2020\n        Wittenberg University\nInterests\nStatistics in sports\nData visualization\nUsing R and RStudio for data science\nStatistics education\nContact\n   nminhquang.99@gmail.com\n   @qntkhvn\nMy old website: qntkhvn.github.io/quang\n\n\n\n",
